# NutriSave-AI-Smart-AI-for-Reducing-Food-Waste

 Food waste is a growing global challenge, leading to economic losses, resource depletion, and environmental issues. This project aims to develop an AI-powered food waste management system that utilizes machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics to optimize food distribution, predict spoilage, and improve overall waste management. By integrating AI into the food supply chain, the system enhances sustainability and efficiency, benefiting businesses, consumers, and charitable organizations. The proposed solution includes smart food matching, real-time availability tracking, expiry prediction, blockchain-based verification, and predictive demand-supply analysis. Through automation and advanced analytics, this system aims to reduce food waste, optimize redistribution, and promote responsible consumption.
